### React Fundamental Concepts

Here is a list of react fundamental concepts that are used in this project.

- **Components:** React is based on components, which are the building blocks of any react web project. We can break down our website into reusable, self-contained pieces (e.g., buttons, forms, headers) that manage their own state and logic.
- **JSX (JavaScript XML):** React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows developer to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It's a cleaner and more declarative way to define your UI elements within React components.
- **State & Props:** State refers to data that can change over time and is managed within a component. Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent components to child components. These are central to how data flows in a React app.
- **Event Handling:** React uses event handling to respond to user interactions, like clicks or form submissions.
- **useEffect Hook:** This hook is used for managing side effects in functional components, like fetching data, subscribing to external events, or manually changing the DOM. It's key for handling operations that aren't purely UI rendering.
- **Context API:** The Context API allows to share state across multiple components without manually passing props through every level of the component tree. It's especially useful for things like theming, authentication status, language settings, etc.

### Data Management

In this project, both ContexAPI & LocalStorage are used to store and managing data.
